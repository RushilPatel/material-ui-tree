## Useful commands

####Running a Local Development Web Server
To debug code and run end-to-end tests, it is often useful to have a local HTTP server. 
For this purpose, we have made available a local web server based on Node.js.

From your terminal go to your repostiroy folder:

    $ cd /path-to-my-folder/material-ui-tree

To start the web server, use the command:

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

To access the local server, enter the following URL into your web browser:

    http://localhost:8000

By default, it serves the contents of the `index.html`
